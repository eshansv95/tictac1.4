    <ul>
    <li><p>While tic-tac-toe may seem simple, it's actually quite complex from a mathematical perspective. There are 255,168 possible games, considering that each player has 9 moves available in a 3x3 grid.</p></li>
    <li><p>Tic-Tac-Toe serves as a simple yet effective training ground for neural networks. Researchers use it to develop and test neural network architectures due to its straightforward rules and clear win conditions.</p></li>
    <li><p>Despite its simplicity, Tic-Tac-Toe can reveal insights into human psychology, including decision-making biases, risk aversion, and competitive behavior. Analyzing player choices and strategies sheds light on fundamental aspects of human cognition and behavior.</p></li>

       <p id="three">Now think about 3D tic tac toe</p>
        <li><p>One of the earliest computer implementations of 3D Tic-Tac-Toe was created in the 1960s by Christopher Strachey, a British computer scientist. He developed a program for the Ferranti Mark I computer, which was one of the first stored-program computers.</p></li>
        <li><p>The mathematical complexity of 3D Tic-Tac-Toe increases significantly compared to the traditional 2D version. There are many more possible winning combinations due to the added dimension, making optimal gameplay more challenging.</p></li>
